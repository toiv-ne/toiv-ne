## Salutations!

### I'm currently attending ASU studying Graphic Information Technology and Focusing on User Experience/User Interface! I enjoy HTML and creating graphics. I hope to finish my Bachelors as soon as possible and beginning work on my Masters. I also love game development, playing video games, reading, and writing (currently only short stories).
